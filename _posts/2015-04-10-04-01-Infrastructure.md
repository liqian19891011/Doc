Restier provides a connection between various data sources and existing clients. The framework contains 4 components: Core, Module, Provider and Publisher:
* The core component provides functionalities for building up domain specific metadata, and logic for data CRUD processing flow. It also includes some extensible interfaces which allows pluggable modules.
* The module component provides the common service elements such as authorization, logging, and conventions that allow users to set up a service more quickly.
* The provider component includes data source adapters which provide functionalities for building up metadata and conduct data exchange with external data sources.
* The publisher component provides functionalities for exposing the domain specific data via a new service interface, which could be understand by existing clients.
